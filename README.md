# SimpleRegressor

This is a very simple implementation of the least square linear regression model which I learnt back in Statistics class in highschool. This is one of the simpler and more efficient machine learning training algorithms. The program can predict both the x and y values of the dataset based on request. Pull requests are highly encouraged. For bug reports or queries or modification requests, contact me at ksmahmoo@edu.uwaterloo.ca
